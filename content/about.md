I am Simon Mika, and I create things. Professionally I create software products. Either hands on or by creating the organization that builds the products.

I live in Uppsala, Sweden with my wife Sannah and my four kids in a house from 1937 that we have been renovating since 2009.

I mainly write about building software and building companies.

You can find out more about me on my page on [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/simonmika) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonmika).
