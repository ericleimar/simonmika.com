title: Rock Star Programmers
---
Sometimes I come across programmers that view themselves as rock stars. Some even label themselves code ninjas. As if they are some kind of programming super hero with special powers.

While a do realize where this comes from. A good programmer can easily be more then ten times as productive as an average one. We do also need good raw models and front figures for our profession.

But programming is almost never a one man show. Most real world projects are impossible to finish yourself within a reasonable time. They are team efforts. Therefore a real programming hero is a someone who not only is a very productive expert but who also helps the rest of the team to reach their full potential by mentoring and encouraging them.

The rock star attitude is the opposite of the humble and encouraging attitude a good mentor. So let us stop taking about code ninjas as a good thing and instead let us celebrate the mentors.
