      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I come across programmers that view themselves as rock stars. Some even label themselves code ninjas. As if they are some kind of programming super hero with special powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a do realize where this comes from. A good programmer can easily be more then ten times as productive as an average one. We do also need good raw models and front figures for our profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But programming is almost never a one man show. Most real world projects are impossible to finish yourself within a reasonable time. They are team efforts. Therefore a real programming hero is a someone who not only is a very productive expert but who also helps the rest of the team to reach their full potential by mentoring and encouraging them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rock star attitude is the opposite of the humble and encouraging attitude a good mentor. So let us stop talking about code ninjas as a good thing and instead let us celebrate the mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
